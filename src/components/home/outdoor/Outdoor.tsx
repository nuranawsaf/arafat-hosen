            to take fast decisions about using color &amp; composition. As well as working quickly allows me to keeps at
            the moment and let me get the essence of the sensor onto the canvas before the light and other factors
            change. Sometimes I also do a final brush-up on my work after I back to my studio from the reference
            picture- as we know there is no wrong way to create artwork!</p>
